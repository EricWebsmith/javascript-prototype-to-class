# Javascript Prototype to Class

Convert old-fasioned functions with prototype to a modern class.

Select the funtions and prototype methods, nothing more.
Press [Ctrl + Shift + P], Type `javascript prototype to class`
Then the code is converted to modern class.

## Issues
- I tested it only by some code in leetcode. I will add more test cases in the future.
- comments outside functions are ignored.
- You have to select the whole function and the prototype method, nothing more, or it will be erroneous.
